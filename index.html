						<div class="project-title"><h3 class="bank-analysis"> <span class="project"> Project Title: </span>Bank Loan Analysis Power BI Project</h3></div>
						<div class="project-section">
							<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
							<p>
								This project involved analyzing bank loan data to identify key factors influencing loan approvals, 
								understand customer demographics, and improve the decision-making process for loan applications. 
								The goal was to provide actionable insights to the bankâ€™s loan approval team and help them make data-driven decisions.
							</p>
						</div>
				
						<div class="project-section">
							<h3>Objectives:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Identify patterns and trends in loan approval and rejection.</li>
								<li>Analyze customer demographics and their impact on loan status.</li>
								<li>Visualize key metrics that help in understanding loan performance.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
				
						<div class="project-section">
							<h3>Data Used:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Customer demographics (age, gender, income, education, etc.).</li>
								<li>Loan application details (loan amount, loan type, tenure, etc.).</li>
								<li>Loan status (approved, rejected, pending).</li>
								<li>Historical loan performance data.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
				
						<div class="project-section">
							<h3>Tools and Techniques:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Power BI:</strong> Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.</li>
								<li><strong>DAX:</strong> Utilized to create calculated columns and measures for deeper insights.</li>
								<li><strong>Data Cleaning and Transformation:</strong> Performed using Power Query in Power BI.</li>
								<li><strong>Key Visualizations:</strong> Used bar charts, pie charts, KPIs, and slicers to present data intuitively.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
				
						<div class="project-section">
							<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Identified that loan approval rates were highest among customers with a steady income and good credit history.</li>
								<li>Observed that younger applicants had lower approval rates due to limited credit history.</li>
								<li>Noted that the majority of rejected loans were due to high debt-to-income ratios.</li>
								<li>Highlighted geographical trends showing certain regions with higher default rates.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
				
						<div class="project-section">
							<h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
							<p>
								Handling missing or inconsistent data in customer demographics, ensuring data accuracy in the transformation process, 
								and designing the dashboard to make it user-friendly for stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise.
							</p>
						</div>
				
						<div class="project-section">
							<h3>Results:</h3>
							<p>
								The analysis provided the bank with a comprehensive view of the factors impacting loan approvals and rejections. 
								Enabled the loan approval team to refine their criteria, reducing the risk of defaults, and improved decision-making efficiency 
								by providing a centralized dashboard for loan performance tracking.
							</p>
						</div>
				
						<div class="project-section">
							<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
							<p>
								This project demonstrated how data visualization and analysis can drive better decision-making in the banking sector. 
								By leveraging Power BI, complex data was transformed into actionable insights, helping the bank optimize its loan approval 
								process and enhance overall performance.
